# helgoboss-learn

Rust crate that provides DAW-agnostic MIDI-learn functionality.

## Status

At the moment, development of this crate is still closely coupled to [ReaLearn](https://github.com/helgoboss/realearn),
currently the only downstream crate. Therefore you won't find it on [crates.io](https://crates.io/) or
[docs.rs](https://docs.rs/).

However, it's designed to be completely independent of ReaLearn and REAPER. So if in future another potential
downstream crate pops up, it will be easy to make *helgoboss-learn* and independent library.
